 for this software to run properly you needed to install everything from requirements.txt
 after that to start this app you first need to set custom local host domain names:
 if you are on windows just open Notepad as administrator and there open : C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc
 select host file and there change from local host to www.kwargs.com
 and then save it and run it
